# Vision-Based-Robotic-System
Vision based robotic system 4th year mechatronics Project
The project is used as a learning aid for students in secondary schools and university in order to equip students with probelm skills and thinkters.
We are using color detection algorithm to detect colors on a convey belt and is later picked  up by a robotic arm and palced in the right container based on the color of the object

Main componets 
1. Robotic arm 
2. Conyver belt system 
3. Camera 
4. Arduino 

Softwares Used
1. VS Code 
2. Proteus
3. Opencv python 
4. ThinkterCad
5.Solid works
6. Matlab

Students ,teachers and lecturers can use our repository to access all the codes and information on our project.
